# Questions

0.  CSS variables reference
0.  is the id attribute on input elements required? what about name?
the label's for= and input's id= should match

The name attribute is used to reference elements in JavaScript, or to reference form data after a form is submitted. Only form elements with a name attribute will have their values passed when submitting a form.

0.  document.documentElement?
the root of the document (<html> in html documents)
