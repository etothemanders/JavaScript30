# Notes

0. omg, forms have a native .reset() method
0. localStorage only stores strings, so the key and value both need to be strings. use JSON.stringify() for complex value data.
0. Also, since the value is a string, JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(key)) to parse it back into native JS types
0. localStorage.getItem(key), .setItem(key, value), .removeItem(key)
0. let event propagation bubble the click event to the parent and add the click handler there
